# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Titanic Kaggle competition. Here, I have documented my data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning model development for the Titanic competition.

## Overview
- The repository contains the Jupyter Notebook with my approach to the Titanic dataset, as well as any associated code or data files.
- The notebook includes detailed data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation metrics.

## File Descriptions
- `titanic_classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis and model development for the Titanic dataset.
- `train.csv`, `test.csv`: Training and testing datasets provided by Kaggle for the Titanic competition.
